# Day Planner Project

## Description

For this project I was assigned to take existing HTML, CSS, and write Javascript that provides functionality to a responsive user interface. It needed to display the current day at the top of the page. The block of time needed to have input capabilities and be color coded to correspond with past, present, and future timeframes. Clicking into a timeblock allows input by the user, and the save button needs to save that input locally. Upon refreshing the page, the saved input needs to persist.

## Installation

To install this project you simply need to be able to access a Google Chrome browser window and have a reliable internet connection.
